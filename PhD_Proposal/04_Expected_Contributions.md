### 4.4.5 LLM-Assisted Interpretation Framework

**Expected Contribution**: The first seismic interpretation system integrating Large Language Model capabilities for intelligent result analysis and decision guidance.

This is the most significant methodological contribution of the research. The framework provides capabilities not available in any existing interpretation software:

| Capability | Description | Innovation Level |
|------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Multimodal Analysis** | LLM interprets both numerical results AND visual outputs (maps, sections) | First in geoscience |
| **Contextual Understanding** | Maintains geological context across interpretation steps | Novel application |
| **Decision Guidance** | Recommends next steps based on current results and objectives | First in seismic |

**Why this is transformative**:

1. **Democratization of expertise**: The LLM provides guidance equivalent to having an expert consultant available throughout the interpretation process, making advanced interpretation accessible to less experienced interpreters.

2. **Consistency and reproducibility**: Unlike human interpreters who may vary in approach, the LLM applies consistent principles while adapting to specific data characteristics.

3. **Efficiency**: Automated analysis of results and generation of reports reduces interpretation cycle time significantly.

4. **Quality assurance**: The LLM can identify inconsistencies, anomalies, or potential errors that might be overlooked in manual review.

5. **Knowledge preservation**: Interpretation rationale is automatically documented, preserving institutional knowledge.

**Comparison with existing software**:
