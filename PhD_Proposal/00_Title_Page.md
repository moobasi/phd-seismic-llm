## Abstract

This research proposes a comprehensive seismic interpretation and reservoir characterization study of the Bornu Chad Basin, northeastern Nigeria, utilizing an innovative AI-augmented workflow. The study integrates conventional geophysical methods with a novel Large Language Model (LLM)-assisted interpretation framework—the first of its kind in seismic interpretation worldwide.

The research utilizes a 3D seismic survey (~1,955 km², 1.84 million traces), 62 2D seismic lines, and well log data from six exploration wells. The methodology encompasses systematic data quality assessment, well-to-seismic correlation with quantified metrics, automated horizon tracking, seismic attribute analysis for DHI identification, fault detection and characterization, and probabilistic volumetric estimation.

The key innovation is the development of an LLM-assisted interpretation system with graphical user interface (GUI) capable of: (1) analyzing both numerical results and visual outputs, (2) providing intelligent decision guidance throughout the interpretation workflow, and (3) enabling natural language interaction for accessible interpretation. This represents a paradigm shift from passive interpretation tools to active interpretation assistants.

Expected contributions include: the first comprehensive 3D seismic interpretation of the Bornu Chad Basin, the first LLM-assisted seismic interpretation framework globally, quantified prospect inventory with resource estimates, and documented workflows applicable to frontier basins. The research addresses Nigeria's strategic need for hydrocarbon exploration diversification while advancing the frontier of AI-augmented geoscience.
